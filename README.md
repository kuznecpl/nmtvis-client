# NMTVis
![NMTVis](src/assets/nmtvis-screenshot.png)
NMTVis is a visual analytics system for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) supporting translators through interactive post-editing.
It was developed as part of my master thesis as a collaboration of the Institute of Natural Language Processing and Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems of the University of Stuttgart.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
